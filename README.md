The best term to be used for this repository would be "Learning compiler step by step", but "building" would be more self-pushing me. So, welcome to building_compiler_step-by-step page! <br>
To be frank enough, i am a bit terrible at compilers. So, To build a framework or develop a new language or build a tool for any OS, then one must have a strong knowledge in compilers. <br>
It is not easy to build it just like that! So, I've decided to start coding from smaller programs. <br>
Pre-requistes:-<br>
--- Interest in compilers. <br>
--- Interest in coding and math.<br>
--- Basic coding skills in C.<br>
